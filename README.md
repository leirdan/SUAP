# SUAP

## 1. What is SUAP?

- SUAP is the abbreviation of _"Sistema Unificado de Administração Pública"_ (or Unified System of Public Administration in English), the system that was implemented in the Federal Institutes from Brazil (including the one in RN, where I live) to manage all the data of the students and professionals related to the Institute.
- It displays the grades of students, their classes, documents, can send e-mails with academic information, order lunch when you need to remain in school in alternative periods and others.
